# General
The solution should be similar to the TV show "Who wants to be a millionaire".
Major difference is that teams play in parallel on the same questions.
Each team has one captain who browses a webpage and then selects team number there.
The game master browses the same application on a hidden URL for the master.
For each question the following happens:
- The game master presents the question and possible answers (ABCD) on a TV screen (e.g. using PPT).
- He then enables the specific question in the application
- The possible answers are also presented on the page the teams have open.
- The team captain discusses with his team members and then clicks the answer (A/B/C/D) they decided upon.
- Game master locks the question and reveals the right answer.
- Application shows points achieved by each team
Application will only be used ONCE. So no need to make it highly adaptable.
App layout/style of the buttons should be similar to the original TV show.

# Functional
use python and javascript as preferred languages
app shall use azure technologies
no login, no user accounts - very simple - just URL based (e.g. hidden admin URL)
data is loaded from json files or is part of code file
