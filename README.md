## Setup

### Local Development

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Access the application:
- Team selection: http://localhost:5000
- Team view: http://localhost:5000/team/1 (replace 1 with team number)
- Admin panel: http://localhost:5000/admin-secret-path-12345

### Azure Deployment

#### Using Azure App Service

1. Create an Azure App Service (Python 3.11)

2. Configure environment variables:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
ADMIN_URL=your-custom-admin-path
```

3. Deploy using Azure CLI:
```bash
az webapp up --name your-app-name --resource-group your-rg --runtime "PYTHON:3.11"
```

Or use the Azure Portal for deployment from GitHub/local Git.

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask sessions
- `ADMIN_URL`: Custom path for admin panel (default: admin-secret-path-12345)
- `MAX_TEAMS`: Maximum number of teams (default: 10)

## Game Questions

Edit `questions.json` to customize your questions. Format:
```json
{
  "questions": [
